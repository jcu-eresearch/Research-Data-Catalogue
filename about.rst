About the Research Data JCU
===========================

Research Data JCU aims to be an easy-to-use site that allows users to create
records describing their research data: what it is, why it was created, who
contributed to the datasets, where it is stored and how it can be used. This
will enable JCU to build a profile of the research data and facilitate sharing
and collaboration both within JCU and externally.

Data Storage
------------

Research Data JCU can be used to store publicly available data up to 50 MB in
size per data record. James Cook University can cater for research data
storage in the 100s of TBs on other systems. Please contact
researchdata@jcu.edu.au to discuss your storage requirements.

Research Data JCU and Research Data Australia
---------------------------------------------

The data descriptions, as well as records of the people and projects
associated with the data are made publicly available and shared with Research
Data Australia (RDA) regardless of whether the actual research data itself is
made publicly available or not. Therefore confidential or sensitive
information about the data should not be included in the metadata record.
